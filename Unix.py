                Unix
                ----

Introduction:
-------------

  I an currently at a 24 hour hackathons (with 16 hours left) and I would like
to create a Unix class that allows me to use my typical Unix commands on my
Windows machines (Laptop, and old XP). 

  I originally was going to create a wrapper for the Windows termanal, but
then I remembered that the list of windows commands for my laptop and XP
are not the same.

  So, I am goint to write this class using only the python standard library.
Wish me luck!

Wanted functionality:

ls
cd
mkdir
"""

class Unix(object):
    """
    Porting a number of the unix commands to Windows
    """
    def __init__(self):
        print "You now have access to the a few linux commands!"
